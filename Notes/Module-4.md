# **Module 4 – Introduction to Deep Learning**

## **1. Fundamentals of Deep Learning**

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses multi-layered neural networks to learn hierarchical representations of data. It excels at capturing complex patterns automatically, making it powerful for tasks like vision, speech, and language processing.

## **2. Deep Feedforward Networks**

Deep feedforward networks are neural architectures where information moves strictly in one direction from input to output through multiple hidden layers. They learn feature representations at increasing levels of abstraction across layers.

## **3. Regularization for Deep Learning**

Regularization techniques help prevent overfitting by controlling model complexity and improving generalization. Methods such as dropout, weight decay, and batch normalization stabilize training and reduce error on unseen data.

## **5. Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**

Convolutional Neural Networks use convolutional layers to extract spatial features from image data efficiently. They learn local patterns like edges and textures, making them highly effective for image classification and computer vision tasks.

## **7. Overview of LSTM**

Long Short-Term Memory networks are specialized recurrent architectures designed to capture long-range dependencies using memory cells and gating mechanisms. They overcome vanishing gradient issues and perform well in tasks involving long sequences.

## **8. Fundamentals of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**

Generative Adversarial Networks consist of a generator and discriminator that compete to create realistic data samples. This adversarial training process enables GANs to generate high-quality synthetic images, audio, and other data types.
